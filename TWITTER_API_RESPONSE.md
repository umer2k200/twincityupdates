# 📝 Twitter Developer Agreement - What to Write

## Fill in the "Use cases" box with this:

```
Our Twin City Updates mobile application is designed to provide residents of Islamabad and Rawalpindi with timely news, traffic updates, weather alerts, and community information.

We will use X's API to:
1. Fetch public tweets from official city government accounts, traffic authorities, and community organizations
2. Display real-time updates about traffic conditions, weather alerts, public announcements, and local events
3. Aggregate city-specific information to keep users informed about developments in the Twin Cities area

The data will be used exclusively within our app for informational purposes. We will not:
- Resell or redistribute the data
- Use the data for marketing purposes unrelated to city updates
- Display tweets in a way that misrepresents the original source

This integration helps residents stay informed about important updates affecting their daily lives, promoting community safety and awareness.
```

## ✅ Then check ALL THREE boxes:

1. ☑️ "You understand that you may not resell anything you receive via the X APIs"
2. ☑️ "You understand your Developer account may be terminated if you violate the Developer Agreement..."
3. ☑️ "You accept the Terms & Conditions"

## 🎯 Click "Submit"

That's it! Once approved, you'll get access to the Twitter API.

**Pro tip:** Keep your response focused on public service and community information. Twitter approves civic/public service apps more readily than commercial ones.
